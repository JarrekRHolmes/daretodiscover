                <p> <b>A:</b> &nbsp; You should always feel comfortable talking to your RA or Housefellow but another great resource is CaPS. A lot of students struggle with stress at CMU and CaPS can offer a lot of help with talking through how your feeling so that you feel comfortable again. Plus, it’s entirely free and confidential so no one needs to know unless you want them to know.</p>
